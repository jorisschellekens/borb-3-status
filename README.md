`borb` is a powerful and flexible Python library for creating and manipulating PDF files.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Progress

The table below represents a small selection of commits that highlight the progress made in developing the new borb library. These are only a handful of the contributions so far; the library is shaping up to be a powerful tool for working with PDFs.

At this stage, the core functionality of reading and writing PDF documents is nearly complete. Remaining features, such as HTML-to-PDF, Markdown-to-PDF, and OCR integration, are tangential to the core purpose and will follow once the foundational functionality is polished.

Currently, I am focused on reading PDF documents. My approach is pragmatic: I process a large corpus of PDF documents and analyze the library's behavior when something fails. This iterative approach helps identify edge cases, improve the code, and ensure robust support for a wide variety of PDF documents.

## Text Extraction Test Results

The table below summarizes the latest test results for text extraction in `borb`. The first column represents the difference in character count (as a percentage) between the extracted text from a PDF and the expected "ground truth" character count. For instance, if a PDF is expected to have 200 characters but the extraction yields 180 characters, this represents a 10% difference and falls into the "10" bucket. The second column shows the fraction of documents that fall into each bucket.

| Difference (%) | Fraction of Documents |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| 0              | 82                    |
| 10             | 2                     |
| 20             | 2                     |
| 30             | 1                     |
| 40             | 0                     |
| 50             | 1                     |
| 60             | 1                     |
| 70             | 0                     |
| 80             | 3                     |
| 90             | 2                     |
| 100            | 4                     |

### Notes

While the results are not yet ideal, they represent an early stage of development. Future improvements will include:

- Implementing additional text-showing operators.
- Supporting composite fonts.
- Debugging existing functionality for better accuracy and reliability.


## üìñ Overview

`borb` provides a pure Python solution for PDF document management, allowing users to read, write, and manipulate PDFs. It models PDF files in a JSON-like structure, using nested lists, dictionaries, and primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.). Created and maintained as a solo project, `borb` prioritizes common PDF use cases for practical and straightforward usage.

## ‚ú® Features

Explore `borb`‚Äôs capabilities in the [examples repository](https://github.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples) for practical, real-world applications, including:

- PDF Metadata Management (reading, editing)
- Text and Image Extraction
- Adding Annotations (notes, links)
- Content Manipulation (adding text, images, tables, lists)
- Page Layout Management with `PageLayout`

‚Ä¶and much more!

## üöÄ Installation

Install `borb` directly via `pip`:

```bash
pip install borb
```

To ensure you have the latest version, consider the following commands:

```bash
pip uninstall borb
pip install --no-cache borb
```

## üëã Getting Started: Hello World

Create your first PDF in just a few lines of code with `borb`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from borb.pdf import Document, Page, PageLayout, SingleColumnLayout, Paragraph, PDF

# Create an empty Document
d: Document = Document()

# Create an empty Page
p: Page = Page()
d.append_page(p)

# Create a PageLayout
l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)

# Add a Paragraph
l.append_layout_element(Paragraph('Hello World!'))

# Write the PDF
PDF.write(what=d, where_to="assets/output.pdf")

```

## üõ† License

`borb` is dual-licensed under AGPL and a commercial license. 

The AGPL (Affero General Public License) is an open-source license, but commercial use cases require a paid license, especially if you intend to:

- Offer paid PDF services (e.g., PDF generation in cloud applications)
- Use `borb` in closed-source projects
- Distribute `borb` in any closed-source product
